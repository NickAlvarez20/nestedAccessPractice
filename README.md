No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This nestedAccessPractice includes these features:
* Practice exercises for accessing nested data structures
* Functions to sum numbers in deeply nested arrays

## Usage
Run the JavaScript script from the command line:
`node sumAllNumbers.js`
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:
* Master accessing elements in nested arrays and objects
* Practice recursion for traversing complex data structures
* Improve problem-solving skills with real-world data patterns
